### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---
I primarily work with GNU/Linux operating systems, particularly Debian and Arch Linux. I also have experience with other systems such as FreeBSD.

While I occasionally use Windows when necessary for specific tasks, my preference remains with Unix-like environments.

In terms of programming, I have experience with Python and C#/.NET, including XAML for GUI development.

Most of my public code here on GitHub is coded for fun.
Do not use my code in production (except if mentioned otherwise) ðŸš«ðŸ”¥
